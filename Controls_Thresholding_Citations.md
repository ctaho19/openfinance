## 1. PCAOB AS 2315 — Tolerable Deviation Rate (5% Threshold)

### Quote for Slide:
> "If the auditor plans to assess control risk at a low level, and he desires a high degree of assurance from the evidential matter provided by the sample for tests of controls, he might decide that **a tolerable rate of 5 percent or possibly less would be reasonable**."
> 
> — PCAOB AS 2315, ¶.34

### Supporting Quote on Deviations:
> "While deviations from pertinent controls increase the risk of material misstatements in the accounting records, **such deviations do not necessarily result in misstatements**."
> 
> — PCAOB AS 2315, ¶.35

## 2. PCAOB AS 2201 — Deviations ≠ Ineffective Control

### Quote for Slide:
> "Effective internal control over financial reporting provides **reasonable assurance** regarding the reliability of financial reporting... If one or more **material weaknesses** exist, the company's internal control over financial reporting cannot be considered effective."
> 
> — PCAOB AS 2201, ¶.02

### Key Principle:
> "A **material weakness** in internal control over financial reporting may exist even when financial statements are not materially misstated."
> 
> — PCAOB AS 2201, ¶.03

**Note:** AS 2201 distinguishes between material weaknesses (which affect the overall control conclusion) and individual control deviations (which may not rise to that level). This supports the principle that isolated deviations don't automatically mean a control is ineffective.

## 3. COSO — Reasonable Assurance, Not Absolute

### Quote for Slide:
> "Internal control is a process... designed to provide **reasonable assurance** regarding the achievement of objectives... These limitations preclude the board and management from having **absolute assurance** of the achievement of the entity's objectives—that is, internal control provides **reasonable but not absolute assurance**."
> 
> — COSO Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013), Chapter 2

### Supporting Quote:
> "An effective system of internal control... provides **reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance**, that the entity will achieve its defined operating, reporting, and compliance objectives."

## 4. IIA Standard 2130 — Proportional Controls Based on Risk

### Quote for Slide:
> "It may be useful for internal auditors to **assess whether the level of a control is appropriate for the risk it addresses**. One tool that many internal auditors use to visually document the relationship is a **risk and control map**, which **plots the risk significance against control effectiveness**."
> 
> — IIA Implementation Guide for Standard 2130 – Control

### Standard Text:
> "The internal audit activity must assist the organization in maintaining effective controls by **evaluating their effectiveness and efficiency** and by promoting continuous improvement."

## 5. ISACA — Risk Appetite and Tolerable Deviation

### Quote for Slide:

> 
> — ISACA Journal, "The Impact of Poor IT Audit Planning and Mitigating Audit Risk" (2020)

### Supporting Quote:
> "Risk-based audits apply the enterprise's **risk appetite, risk tolerance and expectation for compliance**... This strategy allows auditors to gain a clearer understanding of the enterprise's security posture and associated risk."

## 6. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 — Risk-Based Control Selection

### Quote for Slide:
> "The controls are **flexible and customizable** and implemented as part of an **organization-wide process to manage risk**. The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines."
> 
> — NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, Abstract

### Supporting Quote:
> "The assumptions, constraints, **risk tolerance**, priorities, and trade-offs identified as part of the risk framing process inform the risk management strategy, which in turn informs the conduct of risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring activities."

## ERM Positioning Statement

When presenting to Enterprise Risk Management, emphasize:

> "This framework applies **PCAOB AS 2315 tolerable deviation concepts** and is consistent with **COSO's reasonable assurance principle**, **IIA Standard 2130's proportional control guidance**, and **NIST's risk-based control selection methodology**. Critical, High-risk, and SOX controls remain at zero tolerance."
