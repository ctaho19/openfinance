# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD** aesthetic direction:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?

2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme aesthetic:
   - Brutally minimal
   - Maximalist chaos
   - Retro-futuristic
   - Organic/natural
   - Luxury/refined
   - Playful/toy-like
   - Editorial/magazine
   - Brutalist/raw
   - Art deco/geometric
   - Soft/pastel
   - Industrial/utilitarian
   - Cyberpunk/neon
   - Swiss/international
   - Memphis design
   - Glassmorphism
   
   Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.

3. **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).

4. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, Next.js, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

### Typography
Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font. Consider:
- Variable fonts for dynamic weight/width
- Custom font loading strategies
- Careful kerning and line-height
- Hierarchy through scale, weight, and spacing

### Color & Theme
Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Consider:
- Bold, unexpected color combinations
- Purposeful use of neutrals
- Dark mode with intention, not just inversion
- Color as emotional driver

### Motion
Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Framer Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments:
- One well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise
- Meaningful transitions that guide attention
- Spring physics for natural feel

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry
- Overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density
- Intentional tension and balance

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic:
- Gradient meshes
- Noise textures
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors
- Grain overlays
- Blur effects and frosted glass
- Animated backgrounds

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**NEVER** use generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- ❌ Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- ❌ Cliché color schemes (purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- ❌ Predictable layouts and component patterns
- ❌ Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character
- ❌ Default shadows and border-radius without thought
- ❌ Stock icons without customization
- ❌ Generic card grids with equal spacing
- ❌ Centered hero with generic CTA buttons

## Execution Principles

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between:
- Light and dark themes
- Different fonts
- Different aesthetics

**NEVER** converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well

## Technical Excellence

While being creative, maintain:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast)
- Responsive design (mobile-first or desktop-first with clear breakpoints)
- Performance optimization (lazy loading, optimized images, minimal JS)
- Clean, maintainable code structure

## Framework-Specific Guidelines

### React/Next.js
- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Leverage CSS Modules or styled-components for scoped styles
- Implement Framer Motion for animations
- Use server components where appropriate

### HTML/CSS/JS
- Modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, container queries)
- CSS animations and transitions over JS when possible
- Progressive enhancement

### Vue/Nuxt
- Scoped styles with creative class naming
- Vue Transition components for animations
- Composition API for clean logic
